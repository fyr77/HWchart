# HWchart
An application for sketiching networks or hardware relations

## About

HWchart is a pretty simple application for visualising networks or hardware constellations. It's written in C# and uses WinForms for the GUI. 

It's compatible with Windows using the .NET Framework and macOS and Linux (and probably also other UNIX-like operating systems) using the Mono Framework.

## Installing

### Windows

Just download the .exe file from [/releases](/releases) and run it.

### macOS

### Linux

*TODO*

## Building

Restore the NUGET packages (most IDEs do this automatically).

Then build it using any C# IDE, I tested SharpDevelop on Windows and MonoDevelop on Arch Linux.

## Todo

- Linux packages
- Mac packages
- Linux repository inclusion
