# HWchart
An application for sketching networks or hardware relations.

Keep in mind that this application was made years ago and is not written very nicely or efficiently. Needless to say it does not reflect my current coding practices and is kept for archival reasons.

## About

HWchart is a pretty simple application for visualising networks or hardware constellations. It's written in C# and uses WinForms for the GUI. 

It's compatible with Windows using the .NET Framework and macOS and Linux (and probably also other UNIX-like operating systems) using the Mono Framework.

## Installing

### Windows

Just download the .exe file from [the releases](https://github.com/fyr77/HWchart/releases) and run it.

## Building

Restore the NUGET packages (most IDEs do this automatically).

Then build it using any C# IDE, I tested SharpDevelop on Windows and MonoDevelop on Arch Linux.
